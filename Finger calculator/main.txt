Term/Function                        	Meaning

cv2.VideoCapture(0)	                   Opens your laptopâ€™s default camera

mediapipe.solutions.hands.Hands()	   Initializes the hand detection model

max_num_hands=1	                       Detect only one hand (to simplify logic)

cv2.cvtColor()	                       Converts BGR (default OpenCV format) to RGB (needed by MediaPipe)

Q. What is MediaPipe?
MediaPipe is a machine learning framework by Google used for:

Hand detection

Face detection

Pose estimation

Object detection







Q. What is OpenCV?
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):

Used for working with images/videos

Captures, edits, processes frames from your webcam

We use it to display frames, draw on images, crop, convert formats, etc.
















Key Concepts Used in main.py:

Concept	                                                      Description

Webcam Capture	                                         Using OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture) to access your camera feed.
RGB Conversion	                                       Convert BGR (OpenCV default) to RGB (MediaPipe input) using cv2.cvtColor().
Hand Landmark Detection                              	MediaPipe's hand detection model detects key points on the hand, with 21 landmarks.
Drawing Landmarks	                                    Using mp_draw.draw_landmarks() to visualize the detected points and connections.
Real-time Processing	                               The program works in a loop to process frames continuously, providing real-time results.







1. Identify Key Finger Landmarks:
Each finger has 4 key landmarks, with the tip being the most crucial for detecting if a finger is raised. The finger's landmarks for each hand are as follows:

Thumb: 1, 2, 3, 4

Index: 5, 6, 7, 8

Middle: 9, 10, 11, 12

Ring: 13, 14, 15, 16

Pinky: 17, 18, 19, 20

We'll focus on the tip of each finger and compare it to the middle landmark of each finger.



2. Determine if a Finger is Raised:
To determine if a finger is raised, we check the following condition:

For each finger, the tip landmark should be above the middle landmark (when the hand is open and fingers are raised). This means the y-coordinate of the tip landmark is smaller than the y-coordinate of the middle landmark.

If the tip is above the middle (in terms of the y-axis), we can consider that the finger is raised.





Explanation of the Code Changes:
1. count_fingers() Function:
This function counts the number of raised fingers.

We use the finger tips and middle joints of each finger to determine if a finger is raised.

For the thumb, we use its x-axis position instead of the y-axis to determine if itâ€™s raised (because the thumb is oriented differently).

2. Integration with the Main Loop:
The count_fingers() function is called within the main loop, passing the detected landmarks.

The result (the number of raised fingers) is displayed on the screen using cv2.putText().

3. Displaying the Result:
The number of raised fingers is shown in the top-left corner of the window (Raised Fingers: <count>).










Mapping Raised Fingers to Operations:
Letâ€™s define simple operations for different finger counts:

1 Finger = Addition (+)

2 Fingers = Subtraction (-)

3 Fingers = Multiplication (*)

4 Fingers = Division (/)

2. Add Number Inputs:
We need to handle two numbers for each operation, so we will add a way to capture input numbers (e.g., by detecting gestures or using keys).
