 **AI-Powered Finger Calculator**

An AI-based calculator that uses hand gestures to perform basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division using your webcam and fingers!  
Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, this fun little project is perfect for learning Computer Vision and gesture-based interaction.



**Technologies Used**

- `Python`
- `OpenCV` – for real-time video capture and drawing.
- `MediaPipe` – for hand tracking and finger detection.
- `Numpy` (optional) – if you want more math processing.
- `pyautogui` (optional) – for extending actions like shutdown, volume control, etc.
